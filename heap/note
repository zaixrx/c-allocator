apart from the allocator supporting the ability to hand
reused memory ``halloc`` and keep track of unused memory
``hfree`` the allocator should:

- avoid fragmentation as much as possible. -- remerging hfree <:
- work well with parellel and concurrent processes
  (which I won't give a fuck about!). -- >:
- improve the ``memory layout`` with respect to the
  CPU to improve ``cache locality`` and avoid ``false
  sharing``.
